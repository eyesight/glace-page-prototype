# glace-page-prototype

Prototype to start with css and js for the end project glace-page. A page to add recepts for ice-cream and to share in a privat group a selection of ice-creams to rate. So I know which ice-cream I can bring along when I visit my friends.

It's to train my react/redux skills and play with animations.
